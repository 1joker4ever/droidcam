** Missing Audio Support

- On Windows, an audio device driver simulates a virtual microphone
- Seems Linux will need a driver as well.
- JACK (http://jackaudio.org/) is another option, however few chat applications support it
- ALSA plug-ins might also be an option
 - The 'file' plugin seemed promising
 - Could create a "pipe" and have the plugin read from it, and the app writing to it

 - The following [simple plugin] doesn't work though (VLC/Audacity = segfault)

  pcm.testing {
    type file
    slave {
       pcm {
         type hw
         card 0
         device 0
       }
    }
    infile "/dev/urandom"
    format "raw"
  }
