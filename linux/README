REMOVAL

To remove the DroidCam client (or existing old version):

1. Close any running programs. Open the command line.
2. Unload the V4L driver: sudo rmmod v4l2loopback-dc
3. Delete the driver file and the client executable:
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/droidcam
sudo rm -f /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/media/video/v4l2loopback-dc.ko

4. Get rid of droidcam and ‘videodev’ in /etc/modules using your favorite text editor. 
(sudo gedit /etc/modules)

5. Delete ~/.droidcam/ folder


** Missing Audio Support

- On Windows, an audio device driver simulates a virtual microphone

- Seems Linux will need an ALSA driver as well, however given the amount of
 time already spent on this project this is left pending

- JACK (http://jackaudio.org/) is another option, however few chat applications support it

- ALSA plug-ins might also be an option
 - The 'file' plugin seemed promising
 - Could create a "pipe" and have the plugin read from it, and the app writing to it

 - The following [simple plugin] doesn't work though (VLC/Audacity = segfault)

  pcm.testing {
    type file
    slave {
       pcm {
         type hw
         card 0
         device 0
       }
    }
    infile "/dev/urandom"
    format "raw"
  }
